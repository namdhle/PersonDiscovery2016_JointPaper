\section{Future works}
\label{sec:discuss}

We have presented three different methodologies to perform unsupervised person identification in broadcast news. The quantitative analysis was done on the associated corpus of the Multimodal Person Discovery challenge of MediaEval 2016. In this challenge, person discovery is benchmarked as an index retrieval system.

From the experiments, we can observe that clustering-based methods still achieve better accuracy than the alternatives. However, both verification-based and graph-based methods show promising results, which can be further improved by increasing the quality of OCR or more powerful discriminative models. 
%
Furthermore, these two approaches have many interesting improvements and can be exploited by combining them with clustering-based methods.

Our results also emphasize the importance of multimodal processing, which is a future direction of our work.
