\section{Future works}
\label{sec:discuss}

We have presented 3 different approaches to solve the problem of unsupervised person identification in broadcast news. To have a quantitative analysis of their performance, we use the associated corpus of the Multimodal Person Discovery challenge of MediaEval 2016. In this challenge, the problem of person discovery is benchmarked as a indices retrieval system.

From the experiments, we can observe that clustering-based methods still achieve better accuracy than the alternatives. However, both verification-based and graph-based methods show promising results, which can be further improved by increasing the quality of OCR or more powerful discriminative models. 
%
Furthermore, these two approaches have many interesting improvements and can be exploited by combining with clustering-based methods.
%
Our results also emphasize the importance of multimodal processing, which is a future direction of our work.
