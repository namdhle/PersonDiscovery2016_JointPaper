\subsection{Late fusion ranking}

Let $S = \{s_k\}$ be the list of testing shots. Within each shot, $\{N^F_i, t(N^F_i)\}$ is the set of names returned by face naming and the corresponding talking scores and $\{N^A_i, 1.0\}$  is the set of names returned by speaker naming, each is ranked equally with score 1.0.
%
The names which the two methods agree on are ranked highest. 
%
Then, names from face naming are ranked higher than speaker naming  because we found that face naming is more reliable in empirical experiments.
%
Alternative strategies that rank speaker naming equal or higher than face naming gave inferior results.
%
Our ranking strategy is described in Algo. \ref{algo:ranking}. 

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{Ranking names within shots
    \label{algo:ranking}}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
	  \For{$s_k \in S$}
 	  	    \State{$Q_{s_k} = \emptyset$}
		    \State{Face\_naming$(s_k) \Rightarrow (N^F_i, t(N^F_i))$}
				\State{Speaker\_naming$(s_k) \Rightarrow (N^A_j, 1.0)$}
				\For{each $N^F_i$}
					\If{$\exists N^A_j / N^A_j = N^F_i$}
						\State{$Q_{s_k} = Q_{s_k} \cup \{(N^F_i, t(N^F_i) + 2.0)\}$}
					\Else
						\State{$Q_{s_k} = Q_{s_k} \cup \{(N^F_i, t(N^F_i) + 1.0)\}$}
					\EndIf
				\EndFor
				\For{each $N^A_j$}
					\If{not $\exists N^F_i / N^F_i = N^A_j$}
						\State{$Q_{s_k} = Q_{s_k} \cup \{(N^A_j, 1.0)\}$}

\subsection{Audiovisual Similarity}

The graph-based approach by the MOTIF team is extended to multimodality by using a linear combination of the audio and visual similarities defined in section \ref{ssec:graph_gen}: $\sigma^{AV}_{ij} = \beta \sigma^V_{ij} + (1-\beta) \sigma^A_{ij}$. $\beta$ is set experimentally to 0.5.
