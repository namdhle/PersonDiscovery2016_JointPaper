\section{Multimodal improvements}
\label{sec:naming}

As names are propagated based on the outputs of face and speech processing modules independently in CBN and VBN, we employed a fusion strategy to aggregate the results. Meanwhile, it is more straightforward to combine 2 modalities as joint similarity in GBN.

\mypartitle{Late fusion ranking.} Let $S = \{s_k\}$ be the list of testing shots. Within each shot, $\{N^F_i, t(N^F_i)\}$ is the set of names returned by face naming and the corresponding talking scores and $\{N^A_i, 1.0\}$  is the set of names returned by speaker naming, each is ranked equally with score 1.0.
%
The names which the two methods agree on are ranked highest. 
%
Then, names from face naming are ranked higher than speaker naming  because we found that face naming is more reliable in empirical experiments.
%
%Alternative strategies that rank speaker naming equal or higher than face naming gave inferior results.
%
The same late fusion strategy is applied to both clustering-based naming and verification-based naming.

\mypartitle{Audiovisual similarity.} For the graph-based approach, the audio and visual modalities can be combined straightforwardly into one similarity.
%
Thus the distance is extended to multi-modality by using a linear combination of the audio and visual similarities defined in section \ref{ssec:graph_gen}: $\sigma^{AV}_{ij} = \beta \sigma^V_{ij} + (1-\beta) \sigma^A_{ij}$. $\beta$ is set experimentally to 0.5.
